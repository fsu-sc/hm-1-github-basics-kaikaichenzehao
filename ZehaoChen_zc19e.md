## Add a link to the repository you just created in step 1
[Here is the link to the repo](zc19e_MyFirstRepo) I just created before.

# Let me know what you learned and what you are still confused about!
I've learned a lot about github but still confusing about dealing with conflicts!

# Experiment with different styles! (bold, italics, colors, headers, table, bullet points, etc.)

**Bold Text ** should be fine but * italic words *should be fine too.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
The background color is <code style="color:#0969DA">#0969DA</code> and<code style="color:#000000">#000000</code> for dark mode.
$${\color{red}Is\space it \space in\space read?}$$

Quack quack
<text style="color: red">ERROR</text>
